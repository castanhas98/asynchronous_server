# Asynchronous Server

Ideas:
- `top`-like command, that says how many clients are using the server.
- Supporting tcp and udp clients.
- Voice udp broadcast or multicast.

To do (High to Low priority timeline-wise):
  - Client working with echo
  - Server UI
  - Chat between clients
  - Thread-safe session bookkeeping data structure
